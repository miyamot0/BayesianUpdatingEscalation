#Bayesian Updating as Escalation 
This project provides the basis to simulate a series of wins and losses. 

Data can be simulated and then Bayesian Updating can be applied to lagged learning sequences (i.e., Two-, three-, and four-lagged projections).  Simulated data take the form of sequential learning tasks. In randomized sequences of events, a distinct pattern of Wins or Losses is observed and then modeled using Bayesian Updating to determine warranted beliefs.

Warranted beliefs, in Bayesian thinking, refer to the likelihood that an action is likely to succeed taking into account earlier, similar circumstances. As such, warranted beliefs are differentially affected by the amount of exposures as well as the outcomes from each exposure.

##Purpose  
This repository serves as sample usage of Bayesian Updating to model escalation/persistence in no-win situations.
